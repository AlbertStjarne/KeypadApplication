# A Keypad application built in React

A Keypad application built in React. The keypad is a bit odd since it on top of the ten clickable keys also has six non-clickable keys and also note that the keys gets scrambled upon reloading of the page.

- When clicking the numbered keys the number gets saved to state and a \* marks that it has been added
- Upon clicking `Logga in` the entered code gets revealed in the Developer Console
- Upon clicking `X` the last entered digit gets deleted from state and the UI

All components are class-based.

## Using create-react-app

The project was initialized with create-react-app, [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

`$ npx create-react-app .` (runs create-react-app in the current folder)

## Installed dependencies

There are no dependencies installed on top of the once added with create-react-app.

# Instructions to run the application
